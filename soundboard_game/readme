play these with (command line) 

the basic playback command is: 
aplay file.wav
but aplay does not play some of the files that are advertised as .wav but are apparently mpgs in a .wav wrapper or something like that. SO use
mplayer file.wav
instead! 

The files: 

turretted.sh
  a script that runs as a loop and periodically executed turrettes.sh 
This is the main file to invoke when running turrettes in teh background with another program writting numbers into "soundshot"

turrettes.sh 
  Reads the contents (a single decimal number) of the file 
"soundshot" and plays that one (in the order) sound file, one time. 
There are 30 soundclips. It also clears the soundshot file. 

play_serially_all.sh
  Is just for testing...loops through and plays all .wav files serially.
